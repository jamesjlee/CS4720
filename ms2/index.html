		<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
		<p>Magic: The Gathering is an extremely popular trading card game published by Wizards of the Coast. It's somewhat similar to the recently popular Blizzard card game, Hearthstone; however, I believe that Magic allows for more creativity and strategy due to the sheer amount of cards available. The official website for MTG can be found <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/">here</a>. For my CS4720 website project, I will attempt to create a website that tracks the cards in my Magic: The Gathering Cube. </p>
		<p>A cube is basically a collection of 360+ Magic cards which you use to draft with friends. I will be building a Magic: The Gathering cube for the first time with my floormates, and I use my website to keeps track of the cards in cube. Here's some information about <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/li/272">drafting</a> and the <a href="http://www.tomlapille.com/cube/cube.html">cube</a>.</p>

		<p><strong><em>Desired Functionality</em></strong><p>
		<ul id="functionality">
			<li>Add cards to the Cube.</li>
			<li>Remove cards from the Cube.</li>
			<li>Search for specific cards in the Cube by name.</li>
			<li>Categorize cards based on mana color and/or mana cost.</li>
			<li>View all cards in the Cube.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong><em>Vision</em></strong><p>
		<p>This web application will basically serve as an online reference to my Magic Cube. This will probably be really useful for us as we will be adding and removing cards within the Cube throughout the year.</p>

		<p>The card to the left is one of the most powerful cards in magic. It is a zero mana cost card which allows you to gain three mana of any single color. Insanity! It's also worth a lot of

		<p>The card on the bottom is a planeswalker. Planeswalkers are extremely powerful cards with three activatable abilities as seen below. They can be found in the current <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-2015-core-set-card-set-archive-products-game-info">Magic 2015 core set</a>.</p>
